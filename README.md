# School Farm

We are a group of **Egyptian** youth developers. We share the same hobbies, interests and career.
This is our submission repository for the [Koding Hackathon](https://koding.com/Hackathon).

## Description

[![Koding Hackathon](/images/badge.png?raw=true "Koding Hackathon")](https://koding.com/Hackathon)


**SchoolFarm** is a **multiplayer** quiz game that simulates a regular classroom quiz. It is not just a regular quiz game, but a **real-time online** multiplayer one, where students race to the end of the quiz and compete together!

Each player is responsible for their own land and to plant as much grass as they can! The more grass, the more win! 

Simple rules, correct answer grows grass, wrong answer ruins the land!

A teacher will create a group of questions to test the students' knowledge. Then, he will share the QUIZ URL with the students where they can login with their name and choose their favourite character to play with.

Each correct question will add “10” points to the user score, the first one with the most grassy areas (with the correct answers) to reach the goal WINS!

Throughout the quiz, the teacher is able to view all students results (in real time).

There is currently a limit on the students number (10) for demo purposes. However, there is no limit on questions’ number in any quiz.

## Our goal
Our kids play tons of games every day, it's their thing!
**Our goal**  is to combine this fun they get from daily video games with actual knowledge and create fun, competitive yet **useful** games for our children, so that they can learn a lot while enjoying themselves!
